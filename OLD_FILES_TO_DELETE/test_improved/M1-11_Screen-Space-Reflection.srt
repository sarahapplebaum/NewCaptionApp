00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,280
In this video, we're going to go over
screen space reflections, which is a

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,500
topic that deserves a little bit more time
for

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,039
discussion. Screen space reflections allow
you to calculate reflections from the

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,739
scene in real time without needing to use
reflection probes, which we cover in the

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:23,500
next module. This is a very intense
effect, so reflection probes are the more

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,980
performant option, but screen space
reflections are an option if you're

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,470
very high-end devices. You're going to see
this effect mostly on water,

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,159
metallics, and other reflective

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,850
materials. Once we've added screen space
reflections onto our volume,

10
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:40,719
let's take a look at it in

11
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,439
action. Right now in our evening A scene
here, the main thing that uses

12
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,000
reflections are these air ducts above

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,880
us. If I were to disable these reflection
probes, we can see the

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,740
color of these air ducts completely
change, since after all these ducts are

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,240
metallic, and they reflect the light from
the office around it.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,540
These reflection probes approximate the
amount of light that the metallic air

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,620
are going to give off. Let's say I want to
completely do away with reflection probes

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,599
and have these use screen space
reflections to approximate their

19
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,760
reflection. What we can do is we can come
over to the material that these air ducts

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,640
use. For example, if I select this, and I
can see that the element in the

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,920
materials is air ducts B, I can go ahead
and select air ducts B,

22
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,719
toggle receive SSR, and I can do the same
with these

23
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,969
materials as well.

24
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,900
Enable SSR on all of these air duct
materials.

25
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,219
And now if I go into my volume here, and I
start messing

26
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:59,079
around with the screen space reflection
settings, I can start getting these air

27
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,400
ducts to reflect light using the scene
itself rather

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,280
than reflection probes. We can change the
amount of

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,259
smoothness. Minimum smoothness determines
how smooth an object must

30
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,979
be for SSR to be applied. Objects below
this minimum use

31
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,759
another reflection method such as

32
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,819
probes. The smoothness fade start will set
the smoothness

33
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,360
value at which SSR reflections begin to
fade

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,240
out. Lower values results in HDRP fading
out SSR reflections

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,060
for less smooth game objects. We have some
other settings here

36
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,269
such as the ability to reflect the sky,
the screen edge fade distance,

37
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,300
as well as the object thickness. This
controls how thick objects are

38
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,120
inside of your scene. So if I set this
thickness to one, we'll

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,460
see more reflections on our ducts here
because the rays

40
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,200
are not passing through them as much.

41
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:05,520
Additionally, we also have some quality
settings here, so I can set this to high

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,300
quality to get a bit of a better
reflection.

43
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,780
And we can also change the algorithm as

44
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,659
well. From approximation to PBR

45
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:22,620
accumulation. Approximation is a quicker
algorithm which results in

46
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,960
less resources used, but it's not as
accurate for rough

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,620
surfaces. Something like PBR accumulation
accumulates multiple

48
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,319
frames to generate a more accurate

49
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,680
result. And we can control the amount of
accumulation using this accumulation

50
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,730
This gives a more accurate result, but it
is more resource intensive

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,379
and it can lead to some ghosting. used on
Additionally, this algorithm cannot be

52
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,840
transparent materials as those will always
use

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,580
approximation. In the next module, we'll
begin talking about the basics of lighting

54
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,599
inside of HDRP by learning about the
different light types.
