00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.966 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we're going to go over
screen space reflections, which is a

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:07.280 align:middle line:90%
complex

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.500 align:middle line:84%
topic that deserves a little bit more time
for

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.214 align:middle line:84%
discussion. Screen space reflections allow
you to calculate reflections

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:14.039 align:middle line:90%
from the

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.113 align:middle line:84%
scene in real time without needing to use
reflection probes, which we cover

00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:18.739 align:middle line:90%
in the

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:84%
next module. This is a very intense
effect, so reflection probes are the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.500 align:middle line:90%
more

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.606 align:middle line:84%
performant option, but screen space
reflections are an option if you're

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:90%
targeting

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
very high-end devices. You're going to see
this effect mostly on water,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.159 align:middle line:90%
metallics, and other reflective

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
materials. Once we've added screen space
reflections onto our volume,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.719 align:middle line:90%
let's take a look at it in

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.439 align:middle line:84%
action. Right now in our evening A scene
here, the main thing that uses

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:90%
reflections are these air ducts above

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
us. If I were to disable these reflection
probes, we can see the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
color of these air ducts completely
change, since after all these ducts are

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
metallic, and they reflect the light from
the office around it.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.813 align:middle line:84%
These reflection probes approximate the
amount of light that the metallic

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:90%
air ducts

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.109 align:middle line:84%
are going to give off. Let's say I want to
completely do away with

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:90%
reflection probes

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.599 align:middle line:84%
and have these use screen space
reflections to approximate their

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
reflection. What we can do is we can come
over to the material that these

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:90%
air ducts

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
use. For example, if I select this, and I
can see that the element in the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
materials is air ducts B, I can go ahead
and select air ducts B,

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.719 align:middle line:84%
toggle receive SSR, and I can do the same
with these

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:36.969 align:middle line:90%
materials as well.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Enable SSR on all of these air duct
materials.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.219 align:middle line:84%
And now if I go into my volume here, and I
start messing

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.706 align:middle line:84%
around with the screen space reflection
settings, I can start getting these

00:01:58.706 --> 00:01:59.079 align:middle line:90%
air

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
ducts to reflect light using the scene
itself rather

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
than reflection probes. We can change the
amount of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.259 align:middle line:84%
smoothness. Minimum smoothness determines
how smooth an object must

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.979 align:middle line:84%
be for SSR to be applied. Objects below
this minimum use

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.759 align:middle line:90%
another reflection method such as

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:24.819 align:middle line:84%
probes. The smoothness fade start will set
the smoothness

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
value at which SSR reflections begin to
fade

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
out. Lower values results in HDRP fading
out SSR reflections

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
for less smooth game objects. We have some
other settings here

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.269 align:middle line:84%
such as the ability to reflect the sky,
the screen edge fade distance,

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
as well as the object thickness. This
controls how thick objects are

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
inside of your scene. So if I set this
thickness to one, we'll

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
see more reflections on our ducts here
because the rays

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:90%
are not passing through them as much.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:05.265 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, we also have some quality
settings here, so I can set this to

00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%
high

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
quality to get a bit of a better
reflection.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And we can also change the algorithm as

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.659 align:middle line:90%
well. From approximation to PBR

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
accumulation. Approximation is a quicker
algorithm which results in

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
less resources used, but it's not as
accurate for rough

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
surfaces. Something like PBR accumulation
accumulates multiple

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.319 align:middle line:90%
frames to generate a more accurate

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.855 align:middle line:84%
result. And we can control the amount of
accumulation using this

00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:90%
accumulation factor.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
This gives a more accurate result, but it
is more resource intensive

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.722 align:middle line:84%
and it can lead to some ghosting.
Additionally, this algorithm cannot be

00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:50.379 align:middle line:90%
used on

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:84%
transparent materials as those will always
use

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.215 align:middle line:84%
approximation. In the next module, we'll
begin talking about the basics of

00:03:57.215 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
lighting

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.599 align:middle line:84%
inside of HDRP by learning about the
different light types.
