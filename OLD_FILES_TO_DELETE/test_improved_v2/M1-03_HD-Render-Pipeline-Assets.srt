1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,259
In this video, we're going to explore the
HDRP pipeline asset and how

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,279
you can use that to adjust settings inside
of your HDRP

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,779
project. To access the current pipeline

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,420
asset, we can go to edit, project

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,559
settings, and inside of the graphics tab

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,460
here, we can set the default render
pipeline

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,800
asset. This is going to be the default
asset that is used if you do

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,300
not assign individual pipelines inside of
the quality

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,820
tab. So you can see here we have all of
these different quality

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,679
levels. We have high fidelity, balanced
and

11
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,920
performant, and each has a slot for a
render pipeline

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,479
asset. So you can customize the settings
of your project based

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,259
on the quality level that you would

14
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,960
like. So for example, let's say that the
high fidelity quality level

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,920
here has a render pipeline asset with ray
tracing

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,700
enabled. Whereas the performant level has
a different pipeline

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,159
asset with ray tracing

18
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,840
disabled. However, if a quality level does
not have a render pipeline

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,959
asset assigned and we have that quality
level

20
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,480
selected, it's going to fall back on this
pipeline asset

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,480
here. We can select this asset inside of
our assets tab

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,420
by clicking the pipeline asset, and then
we will be directed to

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,670
the folder with the asset

24
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,559
itself. So here we have our HD render
pipeline

25
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:29,129
asset, as well as some global settings and
some default

26
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:34,039
volumes. We can create a new pipeline
asset by right

27
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:38,629
clicking, create, rendering, and then
select

28
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:42,579
HDRP asset. I'm going to select this and
call this

29
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:48,929
high fidelity. I'm going to command D to
duplicate

30
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,919
this and name this performant. And I'm
going to

31
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:55,569
command D and name this

32
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,259
balanced. And now I can go into

33
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:05,689
edit, project settings, quality, and
assign

34
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:07,319
all of my assets to these quality

35
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,269
levels. So I'm going to start with high
fidelity and we'll see it

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,949
right here. I'm going to repeat this step
with balanced.

37
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,539
And I'm also going to repeat this step
with performant.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
And for now I'm just going to leave my
project on

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,020
balanced. And let's select the balanced HD
render pipeline asset.

40
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,060
Inside of a pipeline asset, we can see all
of these settings that have

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,750
to do with rendering, lighting,

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,479
materials, post processing, volumes, XR,
and

43
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,400
virtual texturing. We're going to go over
a lot of these features in

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,960
this course. We're not going to have time
to go through all of these

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,340
settings here, but there are a couple of
settings that we are going to

46
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,539
look at. We have some settings to enable
ray

47
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,180
tracing, enable the GPU resident

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,680
drawer, which can help speed up the
performance of your game by

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,439
drawing more frames on the

50
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,699
GPU. We can enable decals inside of our

51
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:17,599
game, enable dynamic resolution, which
allows you to use upscaling

52
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,139
to boost the frame rate of your

53
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,860
game. We can enable water as well as some
other

54
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,699
settings here. For lighting, we can make
sure that volumetric

55
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:32,979
fog is enabled, as well as making sure our
light probe system is on

56
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,340
adaptive probe volumes.

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,259
Making sure that screen space reflections
is

58
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,599
enabled, since we're going to be using
that later.

59
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,960
As well as enabling screen space

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,379
shadows, and we can also go through and
adjust some of these other

61
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:59,000
settings as well. Now these are settings
that are going to be specific

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,780
to just this render pipeline

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,759
asset. So for example, if you wanted to
turn off screen spacing

64
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,400
ambient occlusion or screen space global
illumination on this

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,580
asset, but you want that enabled for your
high fidelity

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,300
asset, you can do that as

67
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,600
well. The HD render pipeline global
settings asset

68
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,899
is going to allow you to change the
default settings of your

69
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,199
project. More specifically, you can change
all of these settings

70
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,040
inside of the volume here. So we can
change settings with the

71
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,680
exposure, with fog, the visual environment
such as the sky

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,020
type, and more. I'm going to close out of
this window.

73
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,060
Before I forget, let me also enable ray
tracing inside of this

74
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,420
project, since we are going to be
exploring ray

75
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,300
tracing. However, do be aware that for
this

76
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,939
course, in order to be able to use ray

77
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,959
tracing, you must be on a device that
supports ray

78
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,439
tracing. Such as DirectX 12

79
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,000
devices, which would be a Windows

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,339
computer, a PlayStation 5, or an Xbox
Series

81
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,620
X. You may not be able to see the results
of that ray

82
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,259
tracing. You can still implement

83
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,899
them, but Unity won't be able to render

84
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:15,279
it. In the next video, we're going to talk
about volume profiles and

85
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,660
how we can use that to adjust the settings
of our render pipeline

86
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,910
asset even more.
