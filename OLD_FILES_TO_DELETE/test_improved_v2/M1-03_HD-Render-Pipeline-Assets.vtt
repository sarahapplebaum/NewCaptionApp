00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.259 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we're going to explore the
HDRP pipeline asset and how

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.279 align:middle line:84%
you can use that to adjust settings inside
of your HDRP

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.779 align:middle line:90%
project. To access the current pipeline

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.420 align:middle line:90%
asset, we can go to edit, project

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.559 align:middle line:90%
settings, and inside of the graphics tab

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.460 align:middle line:84%
here, we can set the default render
pipeline

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:84%
asset. This is going to be the default
asset that is used if you do

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:84%
not assign individual pipelines inside of
the quality

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:84%
tab. So you can see here we have all of
these different quality

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.679 align:middle line:84%
levels. We have high fidelity, balanced
and

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
performant, and each has a slot for a
render pipeline

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.479 align:middle line:84%
asset. So you can customize the settings
of your project based

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.259 align:middle line:90%
on the quality level that you would

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
like. So for example, let's say that the
high fidelity quality level

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
here has a render pipeline asset with ray
tracing

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
enabled. Whereas the performant level has
a different pipeline

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.159 align:middle line:90%
asset with ray tracing

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
disabled. However, if a quality level does
not have a render pipeline

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.959 align:middle line:84%
asset assigned and we have that quality
level

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:84%
selected, it's going to fall back on this
pipeline asset

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
here. We can select this asset inside of
our assets tab

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:84%
by clicking the pipeline asset, and then
we will be directed to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:90%
the folder with the asset

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.559 align:middle line:84%
itself. So here we have our HD render
pipeline

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.129 align:middle line:84%
asset, as well as some global settings and
some default

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.039 align:middle line:84%
volumes. We can create a new pipeline
asset by right

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:38.629 align:middle line:84%
clicking, create, rendering, and then
select

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.579 align:middle line:84%
HDRP asset. I'm going to select this and
call this

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:48.929 align:middle line:84%
high fidelity. I'm going to command D to
duplicate

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.919 align:middle line:84%
this and name this performant. And I'm
going to

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.569 align:middle line:90%
command D and name this

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.259 align:middle line:90%
balanced. And now I can go into

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:05.689 align:middle line:84%
edit, project settings, quality, and
assign

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.319 align:middle line:90%
all of my assets to these quality

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.269 align:middle line:84%
levels. So I'm going to start with high
fidelity and we'll see it

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.949 align:middle line:84%
right here. I'm going to repeat this step
with balanced.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.539 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also going to repeat this step
with performant.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And for now I'm just going to leave my
project on

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
balanced. And let's select the balanced HD
render pipeline asset.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Inside of a pipeline asset, we can see all
of these settings that have

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:90%
to do with rendering, lighting,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.479 align:middle line:84%
materials, post processing, volumes, XR,
and

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
virtual texturing. We're going to go over
a lot of these features in

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
this course. We're not going to have time
to go through all of these

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
settings here, but there are a couple of
settings that we are going to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.539 align:middle line:84%
look at. We have some settings to enable
ray

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:90%
tracing, enable the GPU resident

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
drawer, which can help speed up the
performance of your game by

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.439 align:middle line:90%
drawing more frames on the

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.699 align:middle line:90%
GPU. We can enable decals inside of our

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:17.599 align:middle line:84%
game, enable dynamic resolution, which
allows you to use upscaling

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.139 align:middle line:90%
to boost the frame rate of your

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
game. We can enable water as well as some
other

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.699 align:middle line:84%
settings here. For lighting, we can make
sure that volumetric

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.979 align:middle line:84%
fog is enabled, as well as making sure our
light probe system is on

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:90%
adaptive probe volumes.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.259 align:middle line:84%
Making sure that screen space reflections
is

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.599 align:middle line:84%
enabled, since we're going to be using
that later.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:90%
As well as enabling screen space

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.379 align:middle line:84%
shadows, and we can also go through and
adjust some of these other

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
settings as well. Now these are settings
that are going to be specific

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:90%
to just this render pipeline

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.759 align:middle line:84%
asset. So for example, if you wanted to
turn off screen spacing

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
ambient occlusion or screen space global
illumination on this

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
asset, but you want that enabled for your
high fidelity

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:90%
asset, you can do that as

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
well. The HD render pipeline global
settings asset

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
is going to allow you to change the
default settings of your

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.199 align:middle line:84%
project. More specifically, you can change
all of these settings

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
inside of the volume here. So we can
change settings with the

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:84%
exposure, with fog, the visual environment
such as the sky

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
type, and more. I'm going to close out of
this window.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Before I forget, let me also enable ray
tracing inside of this

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
project, since we are going to be
exploring ray

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
tracing. However, do be aware that for
this

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.939 align:middle line:90%
course, in order to be able to use ray

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.959 align:middle line:84%
tracing, you must be on a device that
supports ray

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.439 align:middle line:90%
tracing. Such as DirectX 12

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
devices, which would be a Windows

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.339 align:middle line:84%
computer, a PlayStation 5, or an Xbox
Series

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.620 align:middle line:84%
X. You may not be able to see the results
of that ray

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.259 align:middle line:90%
tracing. You can still implement

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.899 align:middle line:90%
them, but Unity won't be able to render

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:15.279 align:middle line:84%
it. In the next video, we're going to talk
about volume profiles and

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
how we can use that to adjust the settings
of our render pipeline

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:90%
asset even more.
