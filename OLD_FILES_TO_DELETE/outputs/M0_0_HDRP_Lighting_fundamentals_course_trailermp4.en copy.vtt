Hi, my name is Sarah, and welcome to
HDRP Lighting Fundamentals.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.380
This course will teach you to create
advanced lighting in Unity using the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.060
High Definition Render Pipeline.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.199
We'll start by setting up an HDRP
project and configuring our pipeline

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.899
for features like screen space ambient
occlusion, volumetrics, and more through

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.420
volume profiles.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.359
Next, we'll explore baked lighting
concepts, learning the differences

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.329
baked, real-time, and mixed lighting
modes.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.340
We'll also cover essentials like light
probes, adaptive probe volumes, and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.740
reflection probes.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.579
Finally, we'll master various light
types and shadows, implementing

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.560
different lighting setups, and 
understanding directional lights while enabling

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.479
both real-time and baked shadows.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.320
By the end of this course, you'll have
the essential skills to use HDRP

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.439
lighting and create high-quality 3D 
environments in Unity.
