 Hi, my name is Sarah and welcome to HDRP Lighting Fundamentals. This course will teach you to create advanced lighting in Unity using the High Definition Render Pipeline. We'll start by setting up an HDRP project and configuring our pipeline assets for features like screen space ambient occlusion, volumetrics, and more through volume profiles. Next, we'll explore baked lighting concepts, learning the differences between baked, real-time, and mixed lighting modes. We'll also cover essentials like light probes, adaptive probe volumes, and reflection probes. Finally, we'll master various light types and shadows, implementing different lighting setups and understanding directional lights while enabling both real-time and baked shadows. By the end of this course, you'll have the essential skills to use HDRP lighting and create high-quality 3D environments in Unity.
