Hi, my name is Sarah and welcome to HDRP
Lighting Fundamentals.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:84%
This course will teach you to create
advanced lighting in Unity using the High

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Definition Render Pipeline.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.219 align:middle line:84%
We'll start by setting up an HDRP
project and configuring our pipeline assets

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:23.899 align:middle line:84%
for features like screen space ambient
occlusion, volumetrics, and more through

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.539 align:middle line:90%
volume profiles.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.339 align:middle line:84%
Next, we'll explore baked lighting
concepts, learning the differences between

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.399 align:middle line:84%
baked, real -time, and mixed lighting
modes.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
We'll also cover essentials like light
probes, adaptive probe volumes, and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:90%
reflection probes.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.579 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we'll master various light
types and shadows, implementing different

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
lighting setups and understanding
directional lights while enabling both real

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.439 align:middle line:90%
-time and baked shadows.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
By the end of this course, you'll have
the essential skills to use HDRP lighting

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and create high -quality 3D environments
in Unity.
